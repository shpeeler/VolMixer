# VolMixerConsole

This application interfaces with the Windows-Core-Audio API to control the audio-mixer for each currently attached audio device.
Relies on serial input from: https://github.com/shpeeler/volmixer_arduino

Service implementaion is on hold, due to problems with Windows-Core-Audio API when called from Windows service.
